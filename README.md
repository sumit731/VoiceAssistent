# Creating a custom voice assistant in Python can be a fun and rewarding project! To build a basic version of a voice assistant, we'll use a few key libraries:

SpeechRecognition: For recognizing speech input from the user.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion to provide responses.
datetime: For date and time operations.
wikipedia: For fetching information from Wikipedia.
webbrowser: To open websites.

# pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia

# How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. It will greet you and wait for your command.
You can say:
"What's the time?"
"Search [your query] on Wikipedia."
"Open [website name]."
"Exit" or "Quit" to end the program.
